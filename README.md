# Here is a short README for using graph4anomaly detection

  1) Short.ipynb is the file that is used to create the graph structure. Here we used a preprocessed dataset from the 5G3E dataset : https://github.com/cedric-cnam/5G3E-dataset

  2) Tools_first_step.py is a utilitary file used in the notebook, we can find all function that I am using here, with anterior version for some of them.
  
  3) Start.py is the main file for the GDN training algorithm from the code provided here : https://github.com/d-ailin/GDN. This version is not using bash for launching script.
  
  4) test.py is the main test file for testing the GDN
  
  5) Util is a set of file used from Start/test
  
  6) models regroup GDN and GDN utilitary file
